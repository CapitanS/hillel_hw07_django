#Questions:
# 1) How to correctly create a project in pure django without subfolders?
# 2) How correct use flake8 and travis before 'git push'?
# 3) How correct use '# noqa'?
# 4) Managing static files. /static/css/styles.css HTTP/1.1" why not myapp/static????

# 5) catalog/models.py HW_10.
# When I deleted in 'timestamp' null (as teacher said) django told:
# 'You are trying to change the nullable field 'timestamp' on logmodel to non-nullable without a default;
# we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).'

# 6) hw_11_queries HW_11.
# Ex.: product.customer_set.all()[0].city.supplier
# Can we in one quire do not use [0] and get query set of all cities?
